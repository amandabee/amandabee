# Open Data

    <aside class="notes">I want to talk a little bit about open data, because it is relevant and important. Over the last decade, countless municipalities have updated existing open records legislation with open *data* laws that mandate that agencies make data available to citizens in usable formats. At least in New York City, </aside>

    <aside class="notes">New York City has a pretty good open data law, but the city's budgets are either exempt or just not enforced. But things like
[member items](http://www.wnyc.org/story/remember-member-items/) are really just trickling in and a lot of budget data either isn't there or isn't accessible. 

 Until very recently, that information was published in a PDF. So if you wanted to, you know, look at it, you had to leap through flaming hoops. It is [now available](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Council-Discretionary-Funding-2009-2/m3fi-rt3k). Much of the rest of the city budget is also available, though hard to muddle through.
 
 So this is a plea to you all to realize and understand that not having access to data makes reporting harder, makes accountability harder, isn't okay. Generally.

<h2>Everyone is Different</h2>
  <aside class="notes">
  We know a lot of things about the human brain, and about how people 
  learn. We could scuttled down some [developmental psychology rabbit 
  holes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Fleming.27s_VAK.2FVARK_model) 
  here, but we know that some people learn better if they can see 
  something visualized. Some people are tactile learners, they need to
  be able to manipulate something themselves. And what that means for
  us is that more people can get more out of your reporting if you 
  incorporate visual storytelling alongside your text.
