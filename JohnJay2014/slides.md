NOTES:
I know a little bit about you from your bios, but I'd love to get a sense of your experience and the kind of data you already have access to.  What are your major hurldes?  How confident are you working with data? Displaying it?

# Why Visualize?

![Cover Art for How to Teach Adults](imgs/how_to_teach_adults-sm.png "How to Teach Adults")

NOTES:
We know these things about how adults learn. About the human brain. We could scuttled down some [developmental psychology rabbit holes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Fleming.27s_VAK.2FVARK_model) 
  here, but we know that some people learn better if they can see something visualized. Some people are tactile learners, they need to be able to manipulate something themselves. And what that means for us is that more people can get more out of your reporting if you incorporate visual storytelling alongside your text.

    <aside class="notes">Many of you are already incorporating some data visualization work:

    <aside class="notes">I actually think Karen's timeline is great, but I can also picture an animation that shows just the locations of the child's many foster homes over time.</aside>

# Varieties of Visualization

## Charts

## Maps

## Small Multiples

-----
# Principles of Design


## Don't make me work

## Don't move the axis

## Show don't tell

NOTES: 
One of the ways that outlets like the NY Times stand out is how they wrap their data. You'll never read a caption like "The chart below shows..." -- words are precious, so conserve them. 

# Great Tools

## For Charts

## For Maps




Data to talk about:
