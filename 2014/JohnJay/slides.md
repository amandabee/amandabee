NOTES:
I know a little bit about you from your bios, but I'd love to get a sense of your experience and the kind of data you already have access to.  What are your major hurldes?  How confident are you working with data? Displaying it?

# Why Visualize?

![Cover Art for How to Teach Adults](imgs/how_to_teach_adults-sm.png "How to Teach Adults")

NOTES:
We know these things about how adults learn. About the human brain. We could scuttled down some [developmental psychology rabbit holes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Fleming.27s_VAK.2FVARK_model)
  here, but we know that some people learn better if they can see something visualized. Some people are tactile learners, they need to be able to manipulate something themselves. And what that means for us is that more people can get more out of your reporting if you incorporate visual storytelling alongside your text.

## Data Visualization Changes Stories

NOTES: The real reason we do this is because it tells a story.

I'm usually opposed to gimicks like the house icon here, but it really drives home how much more water these officials are using. </aside>

# What Makes Data Viz Work?

--v--
## Small Multiples

![NYT Bronx Courts](imgs/nyt_bronx_felony.png)

<small>From [NY Times, Justice Denied](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/nyregion/justice-denied-bronx-court-system-mired-in-delays.html), April 13, 2013</small>

![In one chart](imgs/small_multiples_alt.gif)

NOTES:
Piling the data together in one chart requires me to work more -- there's no way to read this chart without checking the key.

--v--


## Sometimes you don't need a chart.

## Show don't tell
![College Degree](imgs/upshot_on_college.png)

<small>From *NY Times*, [Is College Worth It? Clearly, New Data Say](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/upshot/is-college-worth-it-clearly-new-data-say.html)</small>

NOTES:
One of the ways that outlets like the NY Times stand out is how they wrap their data. You'll never read a caption like "The chart below shows..." -- words are precious, so conserve them.

--v--
## Make the most of your space

![Chart: Poor Record Keeping Hinders Analysis of Domestic Violence Policing Practices](imgs/SFPP_poor_record.jpg)

NOTES:
Look for white space and find a way to use it.

## Don't make me work
--v--

![Gothamist turnstyle data](/talks/2013/JustPublics/slide10.png)

NOTES:
This also happens to be a bit silly because the real takeaway here is "Busy Stations are Busy" which I hope doesn't come as a great surprise. But even to get that far I have to look at the chart, Look up at the top right where it explains that the y-axis is Weekends, remember that the Y axis is the horizontal one, and then the grid isn't even in squares. The point of a visualization is to make the numbers *easier* to understand. Not harder.

--v--
## Don't move the axis

![Fox News on Unemployment](imgs/y-axis_fox.png)

<small>[Media Matters for America](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/07/31/dishonest-fox-chart-bush-tax-cut-edition/189046), July 31, 2012.</small>

![Gas wells chart](/talks/2013/JustPublics/obama_gas1.jpg) ![Gas wells chart do-over](/talks/2013/JustPublics/obama_gas2.png)

<small>NPR's ["It's all politics"](http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/02/13/171935151/chart-check-did-obama-s-graphics-enhance-his-big-speech) fact checked President Obama's 2013 State of the Union slides.

NOTES: Fox definitely doesn't have a monopoly on distorting the Y axis. There are times when you're going to be tempted to zoom in, but make sure you're confident that you aren't grossly distoring the numbers.

## Continuous Things on a Continuum

![2012 Subway ridership, by station](imgs/not_continuous.png "Not continuous")

<small>From *Gothamist*, April 10, 2013</small>

NOTES:
And, while you're in there, ask yourself if you need a key!

Pixels are precious.

--v--
## Numbers Have Perspective, too

![Two Views of the Economy](imgs/nyt_charts.png)
