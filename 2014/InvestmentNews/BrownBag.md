# Questions
What have you done already?

Do you have a data viz style guide? Or any digital style guide?

How many deep dive pieces do you do (vs. fast turnaround?)

Do you have a loose sense of "these are things that we think are cool" or "I want to do more with this story/report"?

Do you iframe content in? Can you? What's your CMS?

I want to start small and then move into big.

This is what I see more or less all the time:

<http://www.citylimits.org/news/articles/5098/group-amplifies-complaints-by-foster-care-parents-kids> -- it's a big long story about how impossible ACS is and how everyone, parents, foster parents, kids is frustrated. And then at the bottom, plop, is a chart of the number of kids in foster care. No context. It takes up 2/3 of the screen, for no apparent reason. Why is it even there?

But you can also let the visuals really drive a story:

This isn't that complex, and it is pretty straightforward. 


Alistair Dant gave a talk at Hacks/Hackers -- you can think of these things in terms of 3 hours, 3 days, 3 months. And for your purposes there's also the 30 minute edition. You probably crank out a lot of those. 

I'm a civic participation person -- most of my interest and focus is in making public policy more intelligible, so you'll see that bias in a lot of what I show you.


## Basic Design Principles
http://darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/data-looks-better-naked/ -- this doesn't have to be the rule for all time, but if your goal is clarity, start here.

I don't know what your strategy is, but you need some core templates. A color scheme. Some standards about where credits go on a data project. 



## Options
The NY Times uses D3, but have a whole team that does nothing but build charts. If you're adding this to your existing editorial workflow, you probably want a different strategy.

## Process
Sketch out what you think this is going to look like. Mark your axes and markup where the numbers are coming from. I can't tell you how often someone comes to my desk with an idea that they can't even put on paper. When you try to draw it, things make a whole lot more sense. 

## Tools
I teach HighCharts and CartoDB. I think both strike a good balance between useability (they aren't hard to use, at the most basic level) and capacity (you can do pretty great things with either)












### Where to keep learning?

NICAR, and to some degree IRE and ONA. Go to he hands on sessions.
