http://www.colormoo.com is great for finding colors. 

http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/ is a great round up of visual encoding examples.

http://cartodb.com/ is a powerful mapping tool that is pretty easy to get started with.

http://www.highcharts.com/ is the charting tool I use the most. It isn't as powerful as D3 but you have a lot of control over what you produce. Any of the charts I highlighted are possible to reproduce in Highcharts.

http://d3js.org/ is a JavaScript library that data teams at the Times use. I haven't wrapped my head around it, though Nick Wells at Crains did some D3 projects while he was at CUNY. 

R and https://www.rstudio.com/ is the other tool the NYT makes heavy use of. It is powerful statistical analysis software with a Very Steep learning curve. I use it, but I don't teach it -- I'm only linking to it because it came up.

Their profile pages do a great job of displaying data, and are a great potential model for something like the RIA Data Center.
