Introduction

Open Data
+ New York City has a pretty good open data law, but the city's budgets are either exempt or just not enforced. I should know, I don't. What I do know is that it was a
[]http://www.wnyc.org/story/remember-member-items/](big deal) when DNA Info got their hands on the city's member item data. Until very recently, that informati_on was published in a PDF. So if you wanted to, you know, look at it, you had to leap through flaming hoops. It is [now available](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Council-Discretionary-Funding-2009-2/m3fi-rt3k). Much of the rest of the city budget is also available, though hard to muddle through.

There are Rules
+ Look at completeness
+ Distorted Axes
+ Keep it readable -- don't [distort your pie chart](http://finalbossform.com/post/95231880775/felony-gun-possession-illegal-possession-of-military), for instance. And not just because it makes it look like you're trapped in Windows 95. 
+ Compare apples and apples -- often, the reason a pile of numbers isn't visualized is because you can't reliably compare them. 
+ Don't [confuse correlation and causation](http://www.businessinsider.com/spurious-correlations-by-tyler-vigen-2014-5#ixzz31FAUIoTZ). ![Not causation](imgs/correlation.png)
+ Don't get religious. [Numbers aren't everything](http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/2014/04/15/welfare-center-managers-dismissed/) -- it is always easier to juke the statistics than change the facts. 

And Suggestions
+ Don't get carried away. If you start asking folks for their very favorite data visualization projects, they'll point you to some beautiful and mezmerizing things, like [frequency](http://www.matthiasdittrich.com/projekte/narratives/visualisation/index.html) in musical numbers. It is beautiful. Or these [Olympic Long Jumps](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/04/sports/olympics/bob-beamons-long-olympic-shadow.html), also beautiful. And there is a place for beautiful things in the world, but try not to forget that you are trying to tell a story and your data should move the story forward not send readers ambling down a side alley.
+ Visual consistency is your friend. Don't make [this](http://www.dailywireless.org/2014/07/28/more-broadband-subs-than-video-subs/) or [this](http://ilovecharts.tumblr.com/post/88368733301/hi-guys-today-im-headed-down-to-the-white) (and don't just toss out everything you know about writing because someone gave you data in "quintiles")

My Favorite Tools
+ CartoDB
+ Highcharts -- some of the really elegant work at the Times is in a tool called D3, but on the whole, Highcharts is a tool you can master and start using in your stories. If you don't want to be a reporter anymore, that's a different conversation.
+ R

Learning
+ http://jour72312.tumblr.com/ -- I post a lot of tutorials on my tumbler and there are a handful of folks working at the intersection of data and reporting who do the same. Everyone learns differently, so find tutorials that suit your learning style.
+ NICAR-L -- I cannot reccommend IRE highly enough. Get there. Take as many hands on sessions as you can.
+ Nerdblogs -- [Quartz](http://quartzthings.tumblr.com), [ProPublica]() ... countless other newsrooms keep blogs where they walk through how they tackled really interesting challenges. Those are great resources.
