## Designing a Data Journalism Course

## Intro

I am a lecturer at CUNY's Graduate School of Journalism where I teach classes on data visualization and newsgames and sometimes plain old reporting. 


## Teaching

So ... I started teaching with a class called "Data Driven Storytelling" in the Spring of 2012. 

Some things about CUNY -- we have some tag line about an integrated curriculum -- I always forget what it is -- but I have to say it is one of the most collegial places I've ever worked and does a really good job of creative problem solving. 

The first semester curriculum doesn't include a lot of electives. There might not be any, but don't quote me on that. I know that everyone takes a broadcast class where they learn some fundamental skills around recording and editing for broadcast. Everyone takes Craft 1, which is the core reporting class. And everyone takes Fundamentals of Interactive, where they skim a whole lot of skills like adding an annotation layer to a video with popcorn or adding an annotation layer to a document on DocumentCloud. And my colleague Russell Chun and I developed and taught a two week data segment that walked through some basic Excel skills and had students develop a very rough story with a chart and a map attached to it and get it online within two weeks. 

And by then I'd been on campus long enough that I was hearing from some of the folks who teach investigative classes about bringing in their colleagues to teach excel workshops. That's great -- I don't need to be the only person who teaches this stuff, but that was when thing started to click for me. So this semester I'm also teaching a faculty workshop on Pivot Tables. 


#### Spring 2012
Storytelling with Data

#### Fall 2012
Storytelling with Data
Fundamentals of Multimedia

I've also been worming my way earlier in the curriculum, so my colleageu Ben Lesser and I now do an extended "Got Numbers" workshop with every first semester Craft class, and everyone does a little bit of spreadsheet work and mapping in Fundamentals of Multimedia. 


#### Spring 2013 
Business reporting classes all have to embed an interactive chart in every story. 
Urban reporting classes all have to incorporate a data viz piece in a budget story. 

#### Fall 2013
Storytelling with Data
Fundamentals of Multimedia
Craft 1 (Writing about Numbers)
Newsgames

#### Spring 2014
Craft II (Quizzes)
Faculty Excel workshops

### How that is working
Getting into classes means I meet a lot of faculty, and that they're more comfortable with me. 


### The future
So what's on the horizon? A 5 week scraping with Python module, lots and lots of integration.


### Newsgames

Newsgames is a five week module that starts with downloading a git repository (we don't actually clone it), editing a .csv, and deploying to a web server. The game, Steve Melendez's Bingo Card generator, isn't really the point. The point is that by the end of week one "Just grab the repo" is an instruction that has meaning, though we also talk about how to write for something like this, how to be clean and consistent and use a single voice across each entry. 

Then we all build a quiz using Mother Jones' script and from there we dive into [Twine](http://twinery.org/), a tool that lets you incorporate scoring and logic into a choose your own adventure game. Last fall, we came up with a "spend a week homeless" game and another that trailed a disabled veteran. 

What we're doing is just storytelling.
