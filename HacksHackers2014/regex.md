## Back of the Napkin RegEx

I am a lecturer at CUNY's Graduate School of Journalism where I teach classes on data visualization and newsgames and sometimes plain old reporting. 

I've also been worming my way earlier in the curriculum, so my colleageu Ben Lesser and I now do an extended "Got Numbers" workshop with every first semester Craft class, and everyone does a little bit of spreadsheet work and mapping in Fundamentals of Multimedia. 

Newsgames is a five week module that starts with downloading a git repository (we don't actually clone it), editing a .csv, and deploying to a web server. The game, Steve Melendez's Bingo Card generator, isn't really the point. The point is that by the end of week one "Just grab the repo" is an instruction that has meaning, though we also talk about how to write for something like this, how to be clean and consistent and use a single voice across each entry. 

Then we all build a quiz using Mother Jones' script and from there we dive into [Twine](http://twinery.org/), a tool that lets you incorporate scoring and logic into a choose your own adventure game. Last fall, we came up with a "spend a week homeless" game and another that trailed a disabled veteran. 

What we're doing is just storytelling.

## So ..okay. Regular Expressions. On a Napkin.

### RegEx


It will shock you to learn that Wikipedia has an extensive and thorough history of [regular expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). 

The first awesome thing about regular expressions is that they're not actually regular. When you start getting fancy you'll start to discover that applications can vary subtly in their implementation. 




I like to start with
