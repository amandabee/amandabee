**What is Open Data?**

  <aside class="notes">Over the last decade, countless municipalities have updated existing open records legislation with open *data* laws that mandate that agencies make data available to citizens in usable formats. </aside>

    We've also seen a blossoming of powerful free and open source tools:

  When communities have access to data, they do amazing things with it.</aside>

  <aside class="notes">New York City publishes huge amounts of data, in compliance Local Law 11 of 2012. Included in that data is a record of every call to 311.   </aside>
  </section>

  <section data-background="lawhelp_map.png">
  <aside class="notes">LawHelpNY used the 311 call data to map not-so-hot spots in New York city. Then, according to Wilneida Negron, they reached out to tenant and housing groups in the neighborhoods with the most complaints, offered them the map for their own advocacy work and circulated Know Your Rights resources and legal aid referrals.

> We took this information and reached out to housing and tenant groups in the
neighborhoods with the most complaints (it turned out to be a specific triangle of neighborhoods in the Bronx) and provided them with the code to the map so they could embed into their websites and use for their own advocacy work and we also circulated Know Your Rights resources about tenants rights to heating and apartment repairs (timely because it was such a cold winter!).  So we used it to target our online outreach, provide grassroots groups with a visualization tool to advance their own work, and provide targeted know your rights information and legal aid referrals in those communities with the highest rates of heating complaints.

  <aside class="notes">For years, Transportation Alternatives collected data on pedestrian and cyclist fatalities. [CrashStat](http://crashstat.org/) is a map of those crashes. And it allowed them to identify stretches of city streets that are particularly dangerous to bikers and walkers. 

  They compiled the data from annual DOT releases, I believe they had to FOIA the data in some years. </aside>

The folks at CartoDB, [mapped that data](http://t.co/tJx8lNmSqF) with a different look. I don't know yet what will come of this but if New York City is going to achieve Vision Zero, more people need to be looking at where the dangerous intersections are.</aside>
