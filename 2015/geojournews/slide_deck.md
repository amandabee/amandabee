    <aside class="notes">Normalize the data to the population. Hello Calc! Find a shapefile. Update one table with data from another. If data is your jam, this probably isn't that impressive, but for journalism students who thought they could get by being great writers, something like "per 100K" is really not obvious.</aside>

    <aside class="notes">And we end up with this very different map that shows a handful of states -- Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota with fatality rates of 5 per 100k and up. And the next highest rate, in South Dakota, is under 4. So suddenly we see this story in front of us. Or at least the start of a story. </aside>

    <aside class="notes">We get some pretty great starts out of students. This is from before I won my battle to banish Google Maps from even our intro classes, but Ryan Kaliath mapped out 311 noise compliants by zip code -- after a two week lesson on pivot tables and mapping -- and you see this really interesting story emerging, which is that folks in the LES and Williamsburg are seriously sick of the noise.</aside>
