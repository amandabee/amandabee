![NYCHA OT](imgs/nycha_ot_hearing.png) ![NYCHA OT](imgs/nycha_ot.png)

[City Council members confront NYCHA over skyrocketing overtime costs](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/nycha-confronted-council-skyrocketing-overtime-costs-article-1.2048002), *New York Daily News*, December 17, 2014; [NYCHA paid $106 million in overtime to workers in 2014 — with plumbers at top of list](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-nycha-paid-106-million-overtime-2014-article-1.2046654) *New York Daily News*, December 16, 2014

NOTES:
Even without a visualization, data is pretty powerful stuff. Ross Keith pulled up NYCHA salary data and was more or less rummaging around in it when he realized that NYCHA Plumbers take home *a lot* of overtime pay. His NY Daily News Cover story has led to City Council Hearings.

...  it is always easier to [juke the statistics](http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-crimestats-lapd-20140810-story.html#page=1) than change the facts

[One Report, Diverging Perspectives](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/05/business/economy/one-report-diverging-perspectives.html), *New York Times*, May 10, 2012

NOTES:
Visualizations aren't neutral.

# Hands On!

We have some good hands on projects to tackle.

## What makes good data viz work?

> [Less is More](https://speakerdeck.com/player/87bb9f00ec1e01308020727faa1f9e72)

> Know your encoding. Not sure? Check out the [Data Viz Catalog](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/)

> Style guides [ProPublica's](https://github.com/propublica/guides) make for consistency across a publication.

[For Women in Tech, Pay Gap Is Unusually Small](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/upshot/flexibility-is-the-reason-for-a-smaller-pay-gap-in-tech-work.html)


NOTES:
Make the most of your space.

![Pending Felony Cases](imgs/bronx_courts.png)

[A Court System Mired in Delays](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/nyregion/justice-denied-bronx-court-system-mired-in-delays.html), *New York Times*; April 4, 2014

NOTES:
Sometimes Small Multiples do a much better job. More small multiples at [Everything the 113th Congress did (and didn’t do), in two amazing charts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/12/18/the-productivity-of-the-113th-congress-such-as-it-was-visualized/)

![The ugly version](../../2014/JohnJay/imgs/small_multiples_alt.gif)

NOTES:
If we put this all on one chart it is a lot harder to read.

## What not to do

![Tax Cut Expiry](../../2013/JustPublics/slide8.png)

<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/07/31/dishonest-fox-chart-bush-tax-cut-edition/189046">Media Matters for America</a>, July 31, 2012.

![Tax Cut Expiry](../../2013/JustPublics/obama_gas1.jpg) ![Tax Cut Expiry](../../2013/JustPublics/obama_gas2.png)

NPR's "It's all politics" <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2013/02/13/171935151/chart-check-did-obama-s-graphics-enhance-his-big-speech">fact checked</a> President Obama's State of the Union slides.

NOTES:

This isn't just a Fox News problem.

![Shiller CAPE vs Implied Return](imgs/shiller.png "Reformed Broker")  

[Shiller CAPE vs Implied Return](http://www.thereformedbroker.com/2014/04/27/shiller-cape-vs-implied-return)


NOTES:
Do things for a reason. This is pretty typical. Why is the green line fatter than the rest. Do we really need to know this is an interactive chart? What am I supposed to be looking at? What is the blue wash adding? We could clean this up. A lot.

--v--

![City Limits Chart](imgs/foster_kids.png)  
[Group Amplifies Complaints by Foster-Care Parents, Kids](http://www.citylimits.org/news/articles/5098/group-amplifies-complaints-by-foster-care-parents-kids), *City Limits*, April 8, 2014

NOTES:
Check your work. We're not in the habit of proofreading data visualizations, but what is going on here? Is this nationally? What should I be taking away from this? And what the heck is "FU 06"?

--v--

Don't just [throw a ton of numbers at me](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/hospice-profits-vs-quality-care/2014/12/26/0becc386-8d40-11e4-8ff4-fb93129c9c8b_graphic.html) -- tell me what I'm looking for. Unless you're just trying to fill space, in which case, go for it. Go fill that space.

If it doesn't belong on a continuum, don't put it on a continuum. What goes between ["Male Driver" and "City Street"](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/race-and-ferguson-police-visualization/)?

![Doubled Up](imgs/doubled_up.png)

[The shocking number of moms who move in with others, and how much money they save](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/31/the-shocking-number-of-moms-who-move-in-with-others-and-how-much-money-they-save/) (and while you're at it, know the difference between "moving" and "staying")

NOTES:
Probably worth scrolling down to look at the last image and talk about formats and not putting text inside of a picture.

--v--

A few more for the wall of shame

Don't [distort your pie chart](http://finalbossform.com/post/95231880775/felony-gun-possession-illegal-possession-of-military).  Use consistent styles to avoid [this](http://www.dailywireless.org/2014/07/28/more-broadband-subs-than-video-subs/) and [this](http://ilovecharts.tumblr.com/post/88368733301/hi-guys-today-im-headed-down-to-the-white).
