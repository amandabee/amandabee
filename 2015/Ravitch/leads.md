# Plan

## Intros -- 10 Min
Who we are. We should just be transparent that we're new to working together so we're still learning a bit about how we each think.

## How Journalists are Using Data -- 30 min 
Amanda will put a deck together. We can hand the mic back and forth as there are things we want to add. 
Examples of charts and data-driven stories. 

## Basic Data Transformations
General scheme:
1. Transform the data in Excel
2. Chart the data in excel, just to see it
3. Move it over to a chart GUI

### Transformation 0
Maybe just take some Fred data and put it into a nicer Chart? Even the data Krugman uses? Just to start with the simplest thing. 

### Transformation Un
Index Data

### Transformation Dois
Over/Under Average



Possible data to work with: 
+ NY State budget data, Citizens Budget Commission, Nat'l Assn of State Budget Officers
+ Medicaid as a percent of the whole budget, state by state



## Where to keep learning:

+ NICAR-L
+ NICAR and IRE conferences
+ Stack Exchange (what makes a good question)
+ Nathan Yau's tutorials

Tools we use: CartoDB, R, Highcharts

More super easy tools:
* that QZ chart maker
* the Medium chart maker
* Datawrapper.de
* 

# Stories to Highlight

Krugman: http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/jebs-bubble/?_r=2
Neither Quoctrung nor I is quite sure why we're juxtaposing the housing bubble and unemployment here, but if you did want to do that, you could go one prettier than a stock FRED chart. 




Dan Keating at the Washington Post has beaten up the DC municipal budget

Not budget, but interesting:

He's got some items ready for the wall of shame, too:

Fails my rules: 

1) Have a clear takeaway. Even if the framing is "by the numbers" tell me what I'm leaving with.

In all seriousness, check out the Chicago Broken Bonds story:
http://apps.chicagotribune.com/bond-debt/

This is a data story, but it's not compiled in neat, easy, tables of data.
That's frustrating for some, I know. But the most worthwhile stories can
come from a lot of behind-the-scenes work, as I imagine this one did.

There's a section on how they researched the story here:

With the skyrocketing student debt we have, here's a wonderful student
project with simple, easy to view charts on how much academic students pay
to fund college athletics.

Here's a wonderful simple piece that shows how to effectively visualize
data on college scholarships.

A group of Oakland, Calif. residents (sadly, no journos participated) did a
very nice job on this project:

You probably would not want to use the same app now, though.

I was thinking about the presentation phase of the seminar.
I just tried data wrapper. <https://datawrapper.de/> I think it's really
cool. And it just occurs to me that I also rely on RAW density design
<http://app.raw.densitydesign.org/#%2F>too.

Both are very intuitive and exports into files that are easy to use. Then
we can show people how a basic flat file can be edited by a designer in the
newsroom. Then we can show the raw output from these programs and then a
version after someone goes through it in illustrator; maybe just to 'wow'
them. 

What do you think?
