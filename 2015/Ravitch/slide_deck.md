    <aside class="notes">I want to talk a little bit about open data, because it is relevant and important. Over the last decade, countless municipalities have updated existing open records legislation with open *data* laws that mandate that agencies make data available to citizens in usable formats. </aside>

  <aside class="notes">New York City has a pretty good open data law, but the city's budgets are either exempt or just not enforced. But things like
[member items](http://www.wnyc.org/story/remember-member-items/) are really just trickling in and a lot of budget data either isn't there or isn't accessible. 

  Until very recently, that information was published in a PDF. So if you wanted to, you know, look at it, you had to leap through flaming hoops. It is [now available](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Council-Discretionary-Funding-2009-2/m3fi-rt3k). Much of the rest of the city budget is also available, though hard to muddle through.

  So this is a plea to you all to realize and understand that not having access to data makes reporting harder, makes accountability harder, isn't okay. Generally.</aside>

    <aside class="notes">Data Visualization provides context. NPR did some reporting that is a little old at this point, though few of the details have changed as far as I know. They looked into data that showed that native kids in South Dakota were significantly more likely to be placed in foster care than white kids, even when the circumstances were similar, and that native kids were overwhelmingly going to (and, according to the Lakota People's Law Project being prescribed anti-psychotics at much higher rates --SJ Merc did a similar story on prescription drugs in CA. You should all do that story.) white foster homes. Their data viz piece looked at all fifty states and flagged the states where native kids are substantially more likely to be in foster care and in non-native homes. </aside>

[City Council members confront NYCHA over skyrocketing overtime costs](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/nycha-confronted-council-skyrocketing-overtime-costs-article-1.2048002), *New York Daily News*, December 17, 2014; [NYCHA paid $106 million in overtime to workers in 2014 â€” with plumbers at top of list](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-nycha-paid-106-million-overtime-2014-article-1.2046654) *New York Daily News*, December 16, 2014

NOTES:
Even without a visualization, data is pretty powerful stuff. Ross Keith pulled up NYCHA salary data and was more or less rummaging around in it when he realized that NYCHA Plumbers take home *a lot* of overtime pay. His NY Daily News Cover story has led to City Council Hearings.

## There Are Rules

+ [Be Complete](/talks/completeness)
+ [Watch Your Axes](/talks/2013/aug092013/)
+ Keep it readable -- don't [distort your pie chart](http://finalbossform.com/post/95231880775/felony-gun-possession-illegal-possession-of-military), for instance. 

+ [Less is More](https://speakerdeck.com/player/87bb9f00ec1e01308020727faa1f9e72#)
+ Know your encoding. [Data Viz Catalog](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/)
+ Make it look good. [Not like this](http://finalbossform.com/post/95231880775/felony-gun-possession-illegal-possession-of-military) or [this](http://www.dailywireless.org/2014/07/28/more-broadband-subs-than-video-subs/) or [this](http://ilovecharts.tumblr.com/post/88368733301/hi-guys-today-im-headed-down-to-the-white)

--v--
** Don't [confuse correlation and causation](http://www.businessinsider.com/spurious-correlations-by-tyler-vigen-2014-5#ixzz31FAUIoTZ)**

# Hands On!

NOTES:
We have some good hands on projects to tackle.

## Tools We Use
+ [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/)
+ R (and [RStudio](http://rstudio.com/))
+ [LibreOffice Calc](http://libreoffice.org/calc)
+ [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/)
+ [D3](http://d3js.org/)

## More super easy tools:
* Medium's [Charted](https://medium.com/data-lab/introducing-charted-15161b2cd71e)
* [Datawrapper](http://Datawrapper.de)
* Quartz's [ChartBuilder](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/)
* [RAW](http://app.raw.densitydesign.org/) -- for flat graphics to edit in illustrator
* Theres been a lot of chatter about <http://silk.co> and people love Tableau, but I often have trouble loading graphics from both. I've had Tableau embeds crash my browser on more than one computer. Plus, it isn't [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

NOTES: 
Sometimes Small Multiples do a much better job.

![The ugly version](../../2014/JohnJay/imgs/small_multiples_alt.gif)

If we put this all on one chart it is a lot harder to read.

[Shiller CAPE vs Implied Return](http://www.thereformedbroker.com/2014/04/27/shiller-cape-vs-implied-return)

  
NOTES:
Do things for a reason. This is pretty typical. Why is the green line fatter than the rest. Do we really need to know this is an interactive chart? What am I supposed to be looking at? What is the blue wash adding? We could clean this up. A lot.

![City Limits Chart](imgs/foster_kids.png)  
[Group Amplifies Complaints by Foster-Care Parents, Kids](http://www.citylimits.org/news/articles/5098/group-amplifies-complaints-by-foster-care-parents-kids), *City Limits*, April 8, 2014

NOTES:
Check your work. We're not in the habit of proofreading data visualizations, but what is going on here? Is this nationally? What should I be taking away from this? And what the heck is "FU 06"?

--v--

Don't just [throw a ton of numbers at me](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/hospice-profits-vs-quality-care/2014/12/26/0becc386-8d40-11e4-8ff4-fb93129c9c8b_graphic.html) -- tell me what I'm looking for. Unless you're just trying to fill space, in which case, go for it. Go fill that space. 

If it doesn't belong on a continuum, don't put it on a continuum. What goes between ["Male Driver" and "City Street"](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/race-and-ferguson-police-visualization/)?

![Doubled Up](imgs/doubled_up.png)

[The shocking number of moms who move in with others, and how much money they save](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/31/the-shocking-number-of-moms-who-move-in-with-others-and-how-much-money-they-save/) (and while you're at it, know the difference between "moving" and "staying") 

NOTES: 
Probably worth scrolling down to look at the last image and talk about formats and not putting text inside of a picture.
