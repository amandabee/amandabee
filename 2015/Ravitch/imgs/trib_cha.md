In 1999, Housing and Urban Development counted 16,846 nonsenior households in Chicago’s projects, considered to be “in good standing.”

It’s always been difficult to know exactly how many individuals that would be. One University of Chicago report estimates that on average, there were 3.2 people per household.

That would have been at least 53,900 people total.

The CHA’s stated plan was to move all those people over the course of a decade and divide them roughly evenly among three types of housing: rehabilitated public housing units, subsidized private market rentals and new mixed-income housing developments.

About a decade later, a 2011 CHA report detailed what happened to former public housing residents.

The “transformation” of public housing benefited some residents. Fifty-six percent of the original residents remained in the system.

The remaining 44 percent left the housing system entirely, for various reasons. Some were just lost in the bureaucratic shuffle.

“Everything they told us, they reneged on,” says former Stateway resident Myia Fleming.
