##CONTENTS OF THIS DIRECTORY

##A NOTE ON CUSTOMIZATION
The game works because no one will win until the last query and exactly one card will win, but everyone will come close to winning. If you decide to make changes to the tables, test your queries out against the bingo cards to make sure the game will still flow smoothly. 

# To Do
[ ] Convert spreadsheets to CSV  
[ ] Use ReportLab to generate Talbles & Bingo Cards  
[ ] Use Python to produce a reasonable set of cards (everyone gets some squares, no one wins before six queries) out of whatever three tables you provide.
