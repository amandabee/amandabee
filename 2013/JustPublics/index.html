I know what lies between 0 and 20,000.

    <div class="handout">Now, some core principles for designing data visualization, at least in the newsroom context. </div>
</div>

<div class="slide"><!--slide 11-->
    <img src="slide10.png" alt="" />
    <div class="handout">
    This is a chart from Gothamist that illustrates something really interesting: subway stations that are busy during the week are pretty busy on the weekends. But even sorting that out is kind of a headache. Which axis is which? 
    
    Your goal, at least in the newsroom, is to make a complicated story easier to understand. If I have to stand here and try to remember which is the x-axis and then remember that ... okay, so that is weekends. I'm already working too hard. (there are other problems with this chart, which basically shows us that busy stations are busy, but that's another story.)  
    One more takeaway here might be that you do need to have a point. A raison d'etre as they say in France. And I didn't come here to help you with that: if all you're telling me is that busy subway stations are busy, your struggle to connect with audiences is not about the charts.

    <div class="handout">Charts are eye catching. We use them to draw readers in.</div>

    <div class="handout">Charts and graphs are illustrations. They help make your point, yes, but they are also there to draw readers in. A compelling photo makes me want to read the story. You see the astronaut Barbie and either that is interesting to you or it isn't. You react or you don't. </div>

You read a story you might not have read if it weren't for that woman's face. 

A chart is supposed to do that, too. It has to stand alone. I have to be able to look at a chart and the surrounding text and say "huh, that's interesting" (or counter intuitive or surprising or obviously wrong). I can't do that if I'm saying, instead, "huh?" Can anyone tell me what this chart is actually about?</div></div>

    <div class="handout">Another thing I spend a lot of time teaching, I hate to say, is how to write for mere mortals. Most newspapers are written for a 7th grade reading level (NB.

There is less evidence, however, to support a long-term relation between these behaviors.

    <div class="handout">Journalists (and academics, no?) are increasingly able to use mapping to explore data before they report. John Keefe and Ailsa Chang put together a quick map of NYC high schools and stop / frisks and used that to quickly find a high school where there would be lots of kids getting stopped. Sure enough, they interviewed plenty of teens who could tell them what it is like to be stopped by the NYPD.

    From <i>The Atlantic</i>, July 2013
    <div class="handout">This is actually interesting <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2290181">research</a>, but I challenge any of you to explain to me what the heck these charts mean. 
    
    What are we looking at here? What is this telling us? 
    
    What we're seeing is that of a random sample of 2317 new fiction editions (The legend is just wrong. The text makes it very clear that these are new -- as opposed to used -- fiction editions) on Amazon, generated by plugging arbitrary ISBNs into the Amazon API and tossing out any that are not fiction or not English language, and then looking each of those up in the Library of Congress (and dumping any that couldn't be found in the LOC.) organized by the year of original publication (or rather, using the date of the earliest edition in the Library as a proxy for publication date). Journalists don't often deal with samples, so we aren't as good at them, but to look at that chart, you wouldn't understand where the 2317 figure is coming from. Surely there are more than 2K works of fiction available on Amazon! 
    
    The authors fail another test of journalism -- this turns out to be a story about the charts, not the impact of copyright on access to works. Your job as a journalist -- or our job, is to decide what matters and cut to the chase.

    <h1><a href="http://library.queensu.ca/ojs/index.php/IEE/article/view/4608">Show Your Work</a></h1>

    <div class="handout">There's something else going on here, which is that Rebecca Rosen didn't make these charts. She got them from the paper whose findings she's reporting on. And since they didn't publish their data, she had to choose between recreating their charts herself by guessing where each value falls, or re-printing the authors originals. So here's one easy thing you can do to ensure good press about your research: share your data with us.
    
    So this is our first challenge -- you have 15 minutes. I want you to sketch out a revision of Healds' chart. You can pick the one from the story that you think is the most responsibly normalized. You don't have to recreate it but I want you to think about how you'd re-frame it. How could we make this graphic more clear? Since we're just working with butcher paper and markers, we'll make do with rough numbers. (Have everyone present their redesigns.)</div>
