We have a grant from the Knight Foundation to launch a participatory journalism project in collaboration with the New York Daily News, to cover environmental health and maintenance issues in NYC's public housing. 

CUNY Journalism School is also in the process of launching a new masters degree in "Social Journalism" -- we're currently waiting for approval from the NYS Department of Education and then we'll start recruiting students. We've hired a new director, Carrie Brown. And that program will be directly focused on community collaborations. 

For us, this is about a couple of things:

+ Accountability: we want to hear from the community that is affected (workers, residents) about how they are experiencing the problem. We want to get the whole story. We want to find ways to hear from multiple residents about what they're experiencing. 

+ Picture the Homeless motto -- "Nothing about us without us" -- you can't cover a story without talking to people who are impacted by it. And sometimes those people are harder to reach. They aren't "experts"; they aren't in your rolodex. They don't even do such a hot job of keeping their phones turned on. So they don't get heard.

+ Experimentation:
+ + Listening Post NOLA is doing some very interesting work, audience expansion and engagement via SMS; we want to build on what they've learned and learn more.
+ + Community Meetings -- can we explore approaches to listening that might help us know whether residents have the basic information that they need? And that the story that is being told to non-residents is consistent with their experiences? Chalkbeat is a network of education blogs covering Tennessee, Colorado, New York and a fourth state that escapes me. They have a practice of reader feedback meetings, which include read-alongs. Reporters read recent stories aloud to a focus group who flags points where they're confused or think the reporting could be improved. 
+ + Social media -- we want to experiment with outlets like Twitter, Flickr, Vine, YouTube. Do any of them bring more traction to stories?
+ + What is lower-tech than SMS? One network of dailies in Alabama included a coupon in the print edition. "Cut this out and send it in; tell us about your experiences with Obamacare." And they got a huge response. 

+ Journalism is work. I'm a lot less worried about whether or not journalists will have jobs (I think they will. I think we need to make sure they do, but I think we'll do that.) and more about making sure that the labor of covering local policy is paid labor. Fundamentally, democracy depends on good information. I'm not interested in going to a city council hearing on youth services, but I do want to know that there are going to be camp options for my foster kids. I want someone else to sit in on those meetings and let me know when they get interesting. And I want it to be someone who has covered the budget process before and can tell the same old budget dance from a real policy change. 

+ The Tow Center has a great report on "user generated content" which starts with an acknowledgement that "user generated content" is a flawed term for a thing that doesn't have a better name. I think newsrooms do have a fundamental responsibility to let users know what content they produced themselves and what was provided by readers.
