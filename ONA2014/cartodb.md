So I'm going to walk through a little exercise we do in my class to get to know CartoDB. 

One of the things New York City publishes is a log of every call to 311. So I downloaded all the data and used a pivot table to organize the calls by community board. (in class you have to do the pivot table yourself)

So here's a core map concept: you map things in one of three ways. "points" have a latitude and longitude. They're single spots on the globe.
