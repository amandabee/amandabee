<aside class="notes"> You are going to need a CartoDB account to follow along today, and you're going to need a credit card to sign up, but!  I have a promo code. There are about enough coupons for everyone in the room. It will get you a $350 CartoDB credit. You can use that for one year access to a Magellan account, but you should mark your calendar so you can cut off the account before you get billed for it. </aside>

    <aside class="notes">We're going to dive right in. If you want to talk about how to use maps as storytelling devices, check out some of the great sessions that are already on the program to do just that.
    
    Huffington Post ran a pretty light piece on banned books, but they also ran this map, of states that ban the most books. Interesting, right? </aside>

  <aside class="notes">
  A basic principle of mapping, especially digital mapping, is that there are basically three ways you can draw on a map. "points" have a latitude and longitude. They're single spots on the globe. "Lines" are a series of points that are connected together -- think roads, rivers, directions, routes. And "shapes" are a series of points connected to form some kind of polygon. States, nations, city borders, congressional districts.
