Slide: Open Lab

I run an art and technology residency at BuzzFeed called the Open Lab for Journalism, Technology, and the Arts.

We have five fellows who spend a year pulling at the edges of how we tell stories and gather information.

Everything we do is open source -- for us that means that we publish our code, warts and all. We publish source files for our 3d prototypes, and we document our processes.

There are a few reasons why we do this. The first is practical: Open Lab fellowships are a year long. BuzzFeed wants to be able to use the work that the lab fellows produce. And the fellows want to be able to continue to use their work. Open Source licenses mean that both can be true.

When we talk about Open Source, we mean a whole lot of different things. We mean mapping data in Open Street Maps, music and images released with Creative Commons licenses, the design for a really smart [prosthetic arm](http://openprosthetics.org/) or the plans for a [pedal powered root washer](http://farmhack.org/tools) interface elements, code.

Basically, if you can copyright it, you can open it. "Source" probably isn't the best word, but I can't think of a better one.

I think there are two kinds of people who talk about open source:

+ people who want to talk about the one time they tried some freeware and it didn't work.

+ the people who want to engage in a lengthy debate about the distinction between "Free and Open Source" and just "Open Source" and I'll tell you a thing: there's a difference. There are some licenses like the MIT license that

There are other licenses that are "sticky" -- they require anyone who uses your code or images or text in a project to release their entire project under the same license. It's kind of like saying "sure, okay Disney, you can use my tune as the theme for your next Princess movie, but "

There's a weirdly persistent and pernicious myth that free software is all developed by benevolent hacker-volunteers, totally without remuneration. The truth is that if you look at some of the most successful open source software projects: the GNU/Linux operating system, Python, D3, you're actually looking at tools that are built by the people who use them. Sometimes we're talking about the tools that programmers use to do their jobs (the jobs they get paid for), sometimes we're talking about tools that a lot of people, including programmers, use to manage their lives. Either way, the impulse is usually to contribute to a tool that you need, for yourself, because you need it to work better.

Using software *is* contributing to software.

When you use a tool you build community around that tool. Even if you don't realize it. Because eventually you're going to show a frustrated co-worker that there's another view they can use, one that's way easier. Someone is going to ask you why our office slack has a La Croix emoji and no one else's does and you might laugh and say "I'm not telling" but eventually they're going to figure out how you did that. And then they'll do it and then they'll be better at using Slack, too. And bit by bit, we build community around these tools. You send someone an MS Word document and they realize that you're doing something really smart with outlines. They know it can be done, they do it to.

Every time you post a question on a public forum, or ask for help, you're building community around something.

I'm learning to sew clothing and I realized (a tiny bit too late) that basically no one on public forums sews from Lotta Jansdotter patterns but everyone and their mother has tried making the Grainline Archer and the Scout. And if I were working on either of those patterns, I could go to Burda Style or [Textillia](https://www.textillia.com) and find a half dozen other woman who also tried to modify the arms on the Archer. That community makes all the difference.
