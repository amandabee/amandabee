NOTES:

I run an art and technology residency at BuzzFeed called the Open Lab for Journalism, Technology, and the Arts.

We have five fellows who spend a year working or projects that combine programming and storytelling in creative ways. As a lab, our mission is to pull at the edges of how we tell stories and gather information. For us, that means that we're tinkering with mapping projections together so we can simulate an expensive 10,000 lumen projector with a few smaller projectors. It means we're experimenting with virtual reality interfaces and working with reporters to explore photogrammetry.  

Everything we do is Open Source for two super practical reasons. Or three, or four or five.

The big things that open source does for us, on a practical level, are these:

+ Fellows are here for a year. After that year, they'll go on and do amazing things. And they can take everything they worked on in the lab with them. And BuzzFeed can continue to use those things.

+ Our mission, as a lab, is not to be BuzzFeed's top secret R&D shop. We're here to change journalism. Or at least tug at the threads of what is possible. And we can't do that by showing everyone our finished product and saying 'wish you were here.'

NOTES:

When we talk about Open Source, we mean a whole lot of different things. We mean mapping data in Open Street Maps, music and images released under Creative Commons licenses, the design for a really smart [prosthetic arm](http://openprosthetics.org/) or the plans for a [pedal powered root washer](http://farmhack.org/tools) interface elements, code.

NOTES:

For the lab, being "open" means that we document the bejesus out of everything we do. We publish our code, we publish source files for our 3D prototypes, and we document our process.

NOTES: But being an "open" lab makes all kinds of things possible for us. It recognizes that the value of the lab, from an R&D perspective, is that BuzzFeed has acess to this team of incredibly smart, creative people who are game to try new things. We have this team that is prepared to drop everything to build out a proof of concept.

But we wouldn't be able to do this without collaborators. Every one of us reaches out to our networks for guidance, mentoring, big thinking and little assists. That's basically true everywhere but I think that it matters to say "I'm not asking you to volunteer to help me build my business. This thing I'm building with your help ... you can use it, too. You don't have to reverse engineer it when I'm done. I'll document it."

When you use a tool you build community around that tool. Even if you don't realize it. Because eventually you're going to show a frustrated co-worker that there's another view they can use, one that's way easier. Someone is going to ask you why our office slack has a La Croix emoji and no one else's does and you might laugh and say "I'm not telling" but eventually they're going to figure out how you did that. And then they'll do it and then they'll be better at using Slack, too. And bit by bit, we build community around these tools. You send someone an MS Word document and they realize that you're doing something really smart with outlines. They know it can be done, they do it to.

Every time you post a question on a public forum, or ask for help, you're building community around something.

I'm learning to sew clothing and I realized (a tiny bit too late) that basically no one on public forums sews from Lotta Jansdotter patterns but everyone and their mother has tried making the Grainline Archer and the Scout. And if I were working on either of those patterns, I could go to Burda Style or [Textillia](https://www.textillia.com) and find a half dozen other woman who also tried to modify the arms on the Archer. That community makes all the difference.

# Community


There's a weirdly persistent and pernicious myth that free software is all developed by benevolent hacker-volunteers, totally without remuneration. The truth is that if you look at some of the most successful open source software projects: the GNU/Linux operating system, Python, D3, you're actually looking at tools that are built by the people who use them. Sometimes we're talking about the tools that programmers use to do their jobs (the jobs they get paid for), sometimes we're talking about tools that a lot of people, including programmers, use to manage their lives. Either way, the impulse is usually to contribute to a tool that you need, for yourself, because you need it to work better.
