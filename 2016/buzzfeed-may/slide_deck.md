BuzzFeed Open Lab for Journalism, Technology, and the Arts  

<http://buzzfeed.com/openlab>

Amanda Hickman <- Senior Fellow

\#openlab-chat / SLACK: @amanda / TWITTER: @amandabee / amanda.hickman@buzzfeed.com

NOTES:

The Open Lab is a workshop and fellowship program in the San Francisco bureau. We're part arts fellowship, part R&D lab. We get to approach some of the more interesting challenges in journalism from a product perspective, rather than edit. We're here to explore and pull at the edges of how we gather information and tell stories. And part of my project as the director is to loop us back into the editorial workflow.

## 360° Video

![Field Kit](../imgs/buzzfeed/360_field_kit.jpg) ![Drone](../imgs/buzzfeed/drone-sm.jpg)



NOTES:
Ben is our drone fellow, but he's also been working on a helmet mount that would let cyclists (or motor cyclists) carry a mobile air quality sensor, and he's working with a reporter in the SF bureau on a calibrated noise monitoring project.


We have a helmet mount, which lets the bearer disappear into the camera's blind spot, as well as a handheld rig. We've tested a surf version. This is available. We have a couple of reporters who are signed up to use it but if you want to try it on a story, let us know and we'll get it to you. It is pretty well field tested .

NOTES:
We produced a 360° video of the giants on opening day. Our rig weights a few lbs. Maybe two. There was someone there with a Jaunt, but it weighs 80lbs.

With our rig, you can get right up close -- with a six go-pro rig, if you come within 4ft of the camera, you run the risk of getting chopped to pieces (at least on film.)

We sent one reporter and an intern out to shoot this.

NOTES:
Christine is our resident med school drop out. She loves to answer questions about infectious disease and micro biomes. She is building a plush toy that knows how it is being treated.

She also built a doo-dad that raises and lowers her desk automatically, and a little servo that let's you take stereoscopic images much more precisely.
