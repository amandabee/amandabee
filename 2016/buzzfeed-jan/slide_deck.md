BuzzFeed Open Lab for Journalism, Technology, and the Arts

Amanda Hickman <br />
^^ Senior Fellow

NOTES:
I just want to walk through what the lab is working on and then I'll be in NYC for a few more days and I'd love to brainstorm collaborations with you all.

I run the lab; I'm on a two year fellowship.

Here's what we're up to. |

Ben Kreimer / [@benkreimer](http://twitter.com/benkreimer) -- Beta Fellow

[![Maker Bots](../imgs/buzzfeed/3d_printers-sm.jpg "Our Maker Gear and our Lulz Bot")](http://www.buzzfeed.com/benkreimer/3d-printer-review) ![Camera Mount](../imgs/buzzfeed/360_camera-sm.jpg) ![Drone](../imgs/buzzfeed/drone-sm.jpg)

Drones, 3d Printing, Helmet-mounted Air Quality Sensors, 360Â° Video & Audio

NOTES:
Ben is our drone fellow, but he's also been working on a helmet mount that would let cyclists (or motor cyclists) carry a mobile air quality sensor, and he's working with a reporter in the SF bureau on a calibrated noise monitoring project.

Ben also set up the lab.

NOTES:
Ben and Ainsley have been collaborating on some great video projects. Their first video project went out to the site of a pretty devastating wildfire. 6 million views.

Ben probably has thoughts on process, but Motion Pictures is actively looking for great ideas for 360 video and you should feel free to pitch me or BFMP or your editor. If you're pitching me, let me know whether

![GE Fellow](../imgs/buzzfeed/ge.png "In Partnership with GE")

Internet of Things, Programmable Objects, Medicine

NOTES:
Christine is our resident med school drop out. She loves to answer questions about infectious disease and micro biomes. She is building a plush toy that knows how it is being treated.

She also built a doo-dad that raises and lowers her desk automatically, and a little servo that let's you take stereoscopic images much more precisely.
