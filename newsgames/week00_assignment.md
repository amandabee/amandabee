Welcome Mailer

I'm looking forward to kicking off Newsgames this week with you all.

Before we meet, you will need to:
+ Make sure you have a user account on Digital Storage by logging into the [school password manager](http://services.journalism.cuny.edu/passwordManager/) and using your school WordPress credentials. If you don't see connection information for digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu, file a support ticket with the [help desk](https://help.journalism.cuny.edu/).
+ Install [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) and confirm that you can open it on your laptop. 
+ If you don't already have [Textwrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/), install that, too.
+ Play [Switch](http://www.gothamgazette.com/games/switch/games/index.php?game=switch) for at least 10 minutes.
+ Identify two news or educational games that you think are great and be prepared to discuss the following questions about each: **What is the story that the game tells? What makes the game succeed? Where does the game falter?** 
+ Think of two stories you'd like to tell in game form. Write a pre-pitch of not more than 150 words about each.
