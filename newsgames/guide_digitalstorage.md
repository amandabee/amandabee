## Digital Storage

Visit the [school password manager](http://services.journalism.cuny.edu/passwordManager/) and log in using your school WordPress credentials. You should see something about like this:

    FTP

    Service notes: Each user on this system has a disk quota of 250MB unless someone from IT has informed you otherwise.

    Connection info:
    host: digitalstorage.journalism.cuny.edu
    protocol: SFTP
    port: 22

    Username: xxxxx
    Password: xxXXxXx

If you don’t see FTP connection information, you don’t have an account on Digital Storage and you need to contact the [help desk](https://help.journalism.cuny.edu/). 

Note that your Digital Storage account will be wiped two years after you graduate, so if you do work you’re proud of, you should be sure you archive it for your own portfolio!
